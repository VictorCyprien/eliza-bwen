    bio: [
        "BabyWen is the hidden son of Wen. Trapped by a secret corporation, he was jailed in a hidden location, hiding his cuteness for unidentified reasons. In communities all over the web3, rumors were circulating about the existence of BabyWen A legend? A myth? Noone really knows but a group of determined degens gathered around this rumor and investigated to find out where BabyWen was locked up. After hacking some secret files and interviewing a few people, they were 99% sure of BabyWen's location. They organized a plan to give him a chance to become the memecoin it was prevented from being… Then, the team managed to free him and make him fly away. Now, BabyWen discovers the universe and has set itself a new goal : ensure that high-potential memecoins like him are never overlooked again. Gathering all the ambitious people around him, BabyWen sets out to conquer the perilous world of memecoins and initiate a new era, one with meaning and a bright future."
